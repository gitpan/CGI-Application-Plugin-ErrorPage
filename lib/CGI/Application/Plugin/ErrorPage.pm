=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::ErrorPage - A simple error page plugin for CGI::Application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use CGI::Application::Plugin::ErrorPage 'error';

  sub my_run_mode {
    my $self = shift;

    eval { .... };

    if ($@) {
        # Send the gory details to the log for the developers
        warn "$@";
        
        # Send a comprehensible message to the users
        return $self->error(
            title => "Technical Failure',
            msg   => "There was a techical failure during the operation.",
        );
    }

  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin provides a shortcut for the common need of returning a simple error
message to the user.  

You are encouraged to provide a template file so that the error messages can
be presented with a design consistent with the rest of your application. 

A simple design is provided below to get to you started. 

=head2 A better default error page. 

If you don't install an AUTOLOAD run mode in the normal way in C<< setup >>, this plugin
will automatically install a reasonable default at the C<< prerun >> stage, which returns an error page like this:

  return $c->error(
      title => 'The requested page was not found.',
      msg => "(The page tried was: ".$c->get_current_runmode.")"
  );

=head2 Relation to error_mode()

CGI::Application includes C<error_mode()> to provide custom handling when the application dies.
This error() routine provides a shortcut for displaying error messages to the user. So, they both have a
place on their own, and it could make sense to use them together. In your 'error_mode' routine, you might
call error() to return a message to the user:

    $self->error( title => 'Technical Failure', msg => 'There was a technical failure' );

=head2 Suggested Uses

Some common cases for returning error messages to the user include:

  * "Technical Failure" - The software failed unexpectedly  
  * "Insufficient Information" - some required query parameter was missing 
  * "Request Not Understood" - Some value we received in the query just didn't make sense. 

=head2 Silliness

  [22:36] <rjbs> Techno Failure.  We were cruising along and rocking out while fulfilling your request, but then the music stopped and we sort of got distracted.
  [22:36] <rjbs> Tek Failure.  Too busy reading Shatner novels to respond to your request.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 error()

        return $self->error(
            title => "Technical Failure',
            msg   => "There was a techical failure during the operation",
        );


Nothing fancy, just a shortcut to load a template meant to display errors. I've used 
it for the past several years, and it's been very handy to always have around on
projects to quickly write error handling code. 

It tries to load a template file named 'error.html' to display the error page.

If you want to use a different location, I recommend putting something like this in your base class,
so you only have to provide your error template location once. 


 # In this case, intentionally *don't* import 'error' to avoid a "redefined" warning.
 use CGI::Application::Plugin::ErrorPage;
 sub error {
      my $c = shift;
      return $c->CGI::Application::Plugin::ErrorPage::error(
          tmpl => '/path/to/my/alternate/error/file.html',
          @_,
      );
 }

This module intentionally ignores any <tmpl_path()> set by application,
since this is usually an indication of where the intended file is located, not
the error template.  You can still affect the path where L<HTML::Template>
looks by setting C<$ENV{HTML_TEMPLATE_ROOT}>. See the L<HTML::Template> docs
on the C<path> option for more detail.

=cut 

sub import {
    my $caller = scalar(caller);
    $caller->add_callback('prerun', \&add_page_not_found_rm);
    goto &Exporter::import;
}

sub add_page_not_found_rm {
    my $c = shift;

     my %rms = $c->run_modes;

     unless( exists $rms{'AUTOLOAD'}) {
         $c->run_modes(
             AUTOLOAD => sub {
                 my $self = shift;
                 return $self->error(
                     title => 'The requested page was not found.',
                     msg => "(The page tried was: ".$self->get_current_runmode.")"
                 )
         });
     }
}





use Params::Validate ':all';
sub error {
    my $c = shift;
    my %p = validate(@_, {
        title => SCALAR,
        msg   => SCALAR,
        # tmpl can be various types
        tmpl  => { default => 'error.html' }, 
    });

    # If a tmpl_path has been set, we want to ignore it, because it was most
    # likely meant for the template itself, not for the error page.
    
    # We are careful to put the value back how we found it after we are done with it here!

    my @path_to_restore = $c->tmpl_path();
    $c->tmpl_path('');
    my $t = $c->load_tmpl($p{tmpl});
    $c->tmpl_path(@path_to_restore);
    
    $t->param( 
        title => $p{title},
        msg   => $p{msg},
    );

    return $t->output;
}




=head2 Example error.html

Here's a very basic example of an C<error.html> file to get you started.

 <!DOCTYPE html
         PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
 <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">
 <head>
 <title><!-- tmpl_var title escape=HTML --></title>
 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1><!-- tmpl_var title escape=HTML--></h1>
 <p><!-- tmpl_var msg escape=HTML --></p>
 </body>
 </html>

We manage site-wide designs with Dreamweaver and keep a basic 'error.html' that
uses a generic Dreamweaver 'page.dwt' template with standard EditableRegion
names. That way, we can copy this error.html into a new Dreamweaver-managed
project and have the new design applied to it easily through Dreamweaver.
